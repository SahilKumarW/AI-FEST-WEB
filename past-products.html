        <p>
          Over the years, the RCAI Lab at NED University Karachi has been
          actively involved in developing innovative autonomous vehicle
          technologies. Our dedicated team of researchers and engineers has
          worked on numerous projects, pushing the boundaries of autonomous
          systems and contributing to advancements in the field. Here are some
          of our notable past products:
        </p>

        <div class="product">
          <h3>Project 1: Autonomous Delivery Robot</h3>
          <p>
            Our team developed an autonomous delivery robot capable of
            navigating through complex urban environments. The robot was
            equipped with advanced sensors, computer vision algorithms, and path
            planning capabilities. It successfully demonstrated its ability to
            autonomously deliver packages to designated locations, showcasing
            the potential for efficient and secure last-mile deliveries.

        <div class="product">
          <h3>Project 2: Self-Driving Car Prototype</h3>
          <p>
            In collaboration with industry partners, we designed and built a
            self-driving car prototype. The vehicle incorporated
            state-of-the-art perception systems, machine learning algorithms,
            and real-time decision-making capabilities. Through extensive
            testing and refinement, we achieved significant milestones in
            autonomous driving, including advanced lane keeping, obstacle
            detection and avoidance, and adaptive cruise control.

        <div class="product">
          <h3>Project 3: Intelligent Traffic Management System</h3>
          <p>
            Our team developed an intelligent traffic management system that
            leveraged connected vehicle technology and artificial intelligence.
            The system aimed to enhance traffic flow, reduce congestion, and
            improve overall road safety. By utilizing vehicle-to-vehicle and
            vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, we successfully implemented
            adaptive signal control algorithms that optimized traffic signal
            timings based on real-time traffic conditions.
